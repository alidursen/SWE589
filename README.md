# Android Development, Fall 2018
Aim of this file is to serve as a blog in lieu of Wiki pages. Such a note-keeping ended up necessary due to my experience
with the course leaving me with strong opinions, as my opinions often are.

### Modern Development Paradigms
Turns out, programmers don't code anymore. This may sound silly (it partially is) but look at it this way: Half the code
present in this repo is automatically generated by IDE, and that's only portion of _visible_ code. Invisible code, ie. the 
one that works in the background, is a pill to swallow. At this point, production environments are more _framework_ than
**language**. Truly, what seperates Android projects from Java projects? Not much, or maybe everything: on the surface,
code is of Java language with some... _tools_ working in the background.

And such a magnificent work they do! They manage screens, place objects, manage objects... All is automatic, all is hidden.
At that point can I say that I coded these projects? But of course I'm aware that my ancient sensibilities would never allow
today's products, and as someone who owns a smartphone and uses mobile apps on it, I prefer not to complain too much.

### Android Experience
This has been a blast. Really easy to use tools all around, including the language and the IDE (Android Studio). Let me quickly
note a couple of points of potential improvement and go on telling why I had fun in this course:
* Android Studio's case-sensitivity is a mess. Typing ```string``` will cause IntelliSense to look at you in confusion.
Sometimes not a problem, more often than not frustrating.
* Android documentation... leaves much to be desired. Though -as expected- all functions are there to be found, point of their
existence eludes the reader. Python documentation, which is voluntarily created, is much better to name one.
